# Why Translate This SQL View into a dbt Model?

Translating the `vw_patient_profile_consolidated` SQL view into a [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) model unlocks numerous benefits for **maintainability**, **scalability**, and **data governance** in your analytics workflow.

---

## 1. Modularity & Reusability
- Each CTE (like `visits`, `visit_total`, `dept_counts`, etc.) becomes a standalone dbt model.
- You can `ref()` these models in other transformations or downstream analyses.
- Encourages **"build once, use many times"** across teams and projects.

---

## 2. Clear DAG & Lineage Tracking
- dbt generates a **visual DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** so you can:
  - See dependencies between models
  - Trace the source of any derived field
  - Debug pipeline failures with context

_Example_: From `rpt.appointment` ➝ `stg_visits` ➝ `int_visit_total` ➝ `fct_patient_profile_consolidated`

---

## 3. Automated Testing
- dbt lets you define and run tests like:
  - `not null`
  - `unique`
  - `accepted values`
- Helps catch issues early (e.g., `mrn IS NULL` in `visit_total`).

---

## 4. Version Control & Collaboration
- dbt models are just `.sql` files in Git.
- You can:
  - Code review via pull requests
  - Track historical changes
  - Rollback if something breaks

---

## 5. Auto-Generated Documentation
- Every model and column can include descriptions in `schema.yml`.
- Run `dbt docs generate` to create a searchable **data dictionary** for your entire project.

---

## 6. Environment Promotion (Dev → Staging → Prod)
- dbt supports multiple environments via profiles.
- You can test models in dev before promoting to production without rewriting SQL.

---

## 7. Performance Optimization
- Models can be materialized as:
  - **`view`** for lightweight builds
  - **`table`** for faster downstream joins
  - **`incremental`** for large-scale datasets
- Easily change materialization strategy without rewriting logic.

---

## 8. Data Governance & Trust
- dbt models make transformations **transparent** and **auditable**.
- Stakeholders can see:
  - Where the data came from
  - What business logic was applied
  - Who changed it and when

## Summary

| Traditional SQL View | dbt Model |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Hard to reuse or maintain | Modular & testable |
| No version control | Git-powered |
| Static output | Dynamically compiled |
| Opaque transformations | Transparent and documented |
| Manual testing | Automated testing & CI/CD support |
